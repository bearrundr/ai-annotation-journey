# ai-annotation-journey

This repository documents my learning journey in AI annotation and response evaluation.
The goal is to understand how annotation quality, reasoning clarity, and evaluation consistency affect AI model performance.

I will gradually add notes, small experiments, and structured reflections as I gain hands-on experience.
