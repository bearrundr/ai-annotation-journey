# Why I Started

I am building practical experience in AI annotation and response evaluation to better understand how quality judgments are formed in real-world platforms.

My goal is to document structured observations on consistency, reasoning clarity, and evaluation criteria in applied annotation settings.

This repository serves as a growing record of that work.
